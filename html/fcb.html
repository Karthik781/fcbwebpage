    <h2>Mes Que Un Club</h2>
    <h3>The last Decade 2008-2018!</h3>

    <p>Under Josep Guardiola, the team improved even further. Playing with the same style that Cruyff had introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his team around the club's own youth system and promoted several young talents to the first team, and the result was the greatest Barça team ever.</p>

<p>The greatest international recognition of this came when the FIFA Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010 shortlisted Xavi, Iniesta and Messi for the honour, all three of whom had grown up at La Masia, the residence where young sportspeople of all ages are trained and educated.</p>

<p>This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing string of major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the history of European football. The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under Tito Vilanova (the league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and the Spanish Cup in another historic treble winning season.</p>
